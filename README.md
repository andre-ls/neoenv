# neovim-configs

Repository containing my NeoVim Configuration File. 

The first version was generated at https://vim-bootstrap.com/, for Python Language, CodeDark theme and Neovim.

Every virtual environment needs to contain the following dependencies for all the editor plugins to work correctly:
- Jedi (https://pypi.org/project/jedi/)
- PyNvim (https://pypi.org/project/pynvim/)
